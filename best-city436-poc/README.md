## 🌱 What We Could Build Together at Toku
> ### **_If salary is earned every second, why is it only accessible once a month?_**
> ⚡ I’m committed to exploring this with the Toku team — not just as a thought experiment, but as a system we can build together because we are obsessed with payroll.

Payroll systems today follow rules that feel… inherited. Fixed cycles. Delayed access. Rigid flows built for a different financial era.

**How about we build payroll together as financial infrastructure that adapts to human realities, not just rigid schedules?**

This is just the beginning — let’s build it together and drive innovation in payroll, fix the inefficiencies in a domain I’m obsessed with, and create something meaningful for every employee because it is often overlooked, underorganized, yet critical to every employee’s life.
