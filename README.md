## 🌱 What We Can Build Together at Toku
> ### **_If salary is earned every second, why is it only accessible once a month?_**
> ⚡I’m deeply interested in exploring this design space with the Toku team — not as a finished idea, but as infrastructure we can shape together, driven by a shared obsession with improving how payroll truly works .

Why This Needs Rethinking

>Payroll systems today still operate on inherited rules — fixed cycles and delayed access shaped by historical technical and financial constraints that no longer exist, yet accepted over time as fundamental truths rather than design choices, and rarely questioned despite their impact on real lives.

**How about we build payroll as financial infrastructure that respects and adapts to human realities- not just Inhuman rigid schedules?**

>Insight:Exploring a model of programmable, streaming payroll, where compensation accrues continuously into a rule-governed payroll escrow deployed on-chain.
Employees can access a bounded portion of already-earned wages under deterministic, pre-defined rules — without discretionary HR approvals — while the remaining balance settles automatically at the payroll cycle with taxes, deductions, and compliance fully preserved.

This is just the beginning — let’s build it together and drive innovation in payroll, fix the inefficiencies in a domain I’m obsessed with, and create something meaningful for every employee because it is often overlooked, underorganized, yet critical to every employee’s life.
