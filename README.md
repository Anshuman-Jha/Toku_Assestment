## 🌱 What We Can Build Together at Toku
> ### **_If salary is earned every second, why is it only accessible once a month?_**
> ⚡I’m deeply interested in exploring this design space with the Toku team — not as a finished idea, but as infrastructure we can shape together, driven by a shared obsession with improving how payroll truly works .

Payroll systems today follow rules that feel… inherited. Fixed cycles. Delayed access. Rigid flows built for a different financial era.

**How about we build payroll as financial infrastructure that respects and adapts to human realities- not just Inhuman rigid schedules?**

>Insight:Exploring a model of programmable, streaming payroll, where compensation accrues continuously into a rule-governed payroll escrow deployed on-chain.
Employees can access a bounded portion of already-earned wages under deterministic, pre-defined rules — without discretionary HR approvals — while the remaining balance settles automatically at the payroll cycle with taxes, deductions, and compliance fully preserved.

This is just the beginning — let’s build it together and drive innovation in payroll, fix the inefficiencies in a domain I’m obsessed with, and create something meaningful for every employee because it is often overlooked, underorganized, yet critical to every employee’s life.
